# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to work with strings, file input/output operations, and text manipulation techniques in Python. You'll build programs that can read, process, and analyze text data from files and user input.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Text File Analyzer

#### Description
Create a program that reads a text file and provides various statistics and analysis about its contents. Your program should be able to process any text file and give insights about the text structure and content.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file specified by the user
- Count the total number of characters, words, and lines
- Find the most frequently used words (top 5)
- Calculate the average word length
- Identify the longest and shortest sentences
- Display all results in a user-friendly format

### 🛠️ Task 2: Text Formatter and Cleaner

#### Description
Build a text processing tool that can clean and format text data. This tool should handle common text cleaning tasks like removing extra whitespace, fixing capitalization, and standardizing formatting.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Remove extra whitespace and blank lines
- Convert text to proper title case (first letter of each word capitalized)
- Replace multiple punctuation marks with single ones
- Remove or replace special characters as specified by user
- Save the cleaned text to a new file
- Provide a summary of changes made

### 🛠️ Task 3: Word Search and Replace Tool

#### Description
Create a program that can search for specific words or patterns in text files and replace them with new text. This tool should be able to handle case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Search for specific words or phrases in a text file
- Perform case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches
- Replace found text with user-specified replacement text
- Count how many replacements were made
- Create a backup of the original file before making changes
- Display a report of all changes made
